Hi,

I am excited to begin this adventure into development. Years ago, I had an interest in coding and learned the logic and design with a program created by our military called Raptor prior to learning C#. That was 4 yrs ago. Dispite having loved it, I unfortunately had no choice but to re-enter the workforce. Do to Co-vid 19 I've had the opportunity to re-evaluate my position. I have been accepted to Lambda and am scheduled to begin the Web development cohort Oct 26th, 2020.

ðŸ¤žStay tunned:-)
